# BetterDefusal

BetterDefusal allows you to "defuse" lit TNT and TNT minecarts with a configurable wire cutter.

Did you accidentally set off a TNT block too soon, putting your entire contraption at risk? Fear not! Simply unleash 
your inner bomb squad, save the day, and keep all your progress intact â€“ because who said defusing explosives 
can't be a blast?
